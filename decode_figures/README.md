# Replication of figure generation from analysis of results from decode_pipeline

To replicate the figures in the [LINK TO PREPRINT] data files must be downloaded from the [PROJECT WEBSITE]. 

Once all files are downloaded, the Jupyter notebook Code_for_figures.ipynb can be used to generate analyses and figures. The user should edit the proj_dir variable in the second code cell to the local directory with the downloaded data. 

The script is organized by figure labels, e.g "Figure 1a" or "Extended Data Figure 2c", which can be found by searching the page. It is recommended to run specific desired chunks of the script rather than the entire script at once, as it contains many different analyses. 

Analyses and figures not included in this script can be found in ~/decode_analysis/
